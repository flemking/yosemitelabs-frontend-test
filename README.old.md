### Pokemon Web App User Stories

**Home**
As a user I want to search for a random Pokemon
As a user I want to retrieve a Pokemon by name

**Pokemon Details**
As a user I want to see some details of the Pokemon
As a user I want to add the pokemon to my team if they are not part of it
As a user I want to remove the pokemon from my team if they are part of it

**Your Pokemon**
As a user I want to see all the pokemon on my team
As a user I want to view the selected pokemon on my team
As a user I want to add the pokemon to my team (maximum of 6 pokemon per user)
As a user I want to remove the pokemon from my team (no minimum number of pokemon per user)

\*Note - the userâ€™s pokemon team does not need to be saved when the session is closed, but it would be nice if the user goes back to their browser and finds that their chosen pokemon is still part of their team. You can also add other features that you think would be good for the user.
